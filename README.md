## Introduction

Quantum computing offers new ways to process information, and this project leverages those capabilities to enhance traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs are widely used in tasks involving sequential data, such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and more. By integrating quantum principles, we aim to improve performance and efficiency.

## Features

- **Quantum Integration**: Utilizes quantum algorithms to optimize LSTM processes.
- **Deep Learning Support**: Fully compatible with popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex models.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to install and integrate into existing projects.

## Installation

To get started with QLSTM, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seif-007/Quantum_Long_Short_Term_Memory.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Quantum_Long_Short_Term_Memory
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using QLSTM in your projects. Here’s a simple example:

```python
from qlstm import QLSTM

# Initialize the QLSTM model
model = QLSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=20)

# Train the model
model.train(training_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

For detailed usage, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/seif-007/Quantum_Long_Short_Term_Memory).

## Architecture

The architecture of QLSTM combines quantum circuits with LSTM layers. Each LSTM cell integrates quantum gates to enhance the learning process. This hybrid model allows for faster convergence and improved accuracy in predictions.

### Quantum Gates

- **Hadamard Gate**: Creates superposition.
- **CNOT Gate**: Entangles qubits for improved information flow.

### LSTM Cells

- **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard.
- **Input Gate**: Determines what new information to store.
- **Output Gate**: Controls the output based on the cell state.

## Examples

### Time Series Forecasting

QLSTM can be applied to time series data for forecasting future values. Here’s a basic implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
from qlstm import QLSTM

# Generate synthetic time series data
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 100, 1000))

# Prepare the data for training
training_data = prepare_data(data)

# Initialize and train the model
model = QLSTM(input_size=1, hidden_size=50)
model.train(training_data)

# Forecast future values
future_values = model.predict(future_data)
```

### Natural Language Processing

For NLP tasks, QLSTM can be used to improve text classification and sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates its use:

```python
from qlstm import QLSTM

# Load and preprocess text data
text_data = load_text_data('data/texts.csv')

# Initialize the model
model = QLSTM(input_size=vocab_size, hidden_size=128)

# Train the model
model.train(text_data)

# Make predictions
results = model.predict(new_texts)
```
